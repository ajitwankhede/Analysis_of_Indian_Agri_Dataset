 The Sustainable Agriculture Dataset in India addresses the critical need for accurate data to support the agricultural ecosystem. 
 
 It empowers stakeholders to make informed decisions, optimize processes, and drive sustainable practices. 
 
 Here in this notebook am going to use ["All Agriculture related Datasets for India"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thammuio/all-agriculture-related-datasets-for-india) from kaggle, The aim of this Dataset is to help Indian Agriculture eco-system with right data. As there is a lack of correct data to get insights into Indian Agriculture, I this this is the best time to collect and create a data set that can help the Indian Agriculture.
 
 The dataset includes information on commodity prices, weather, land usage, crop yield, inputs, pests, and more. By providing access to up-to-date information, it enables informed decision-making, improves productivity, and fosters sustainability. This dataset revolutionizes the agricultural sector, bridging the data gap, and creating a resilient and sustainable future for Indian agriculture.
